// Description:
// Trolls are attacking your comment section! A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

// Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
// Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

//Parameters: your function should take a string as a parameter. do you need to check if the user has given a different data type? Or an empty string?
//Returns: return the given string with vowels removed, not including 'y'
//Examples: the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
//Pseudocode: 


function disemvowel(str) {



}
