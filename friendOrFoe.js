// Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

// If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

// Input strings will only contain letters.
// Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

//Params
// an array of strings
//Returns
// an array with only names/strings containing exactly four letters
//Examples
    // Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]
    // Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

    // Input = ["Peter", "Stephen", "Joe"]
    // Output = []
//Pseudocode
// 

function friend (friends) {

    

}

console.log(friend(["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]))
