// Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

//Params: two integers, where a < b
//Returns: an array of all integers between the to give integers, inclusive
//Examples:
    // a = 1
    // b = 4
    // --> [1, 2, 3, 4]
//Pseudocode:

function between (a,b) {



}
